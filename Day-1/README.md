# DevOps Training - Day 1: Introduction to DevOps

## Overview
The first day of the DevOps training focused on laying the foundation of DevOps practices and culture. We began with an introduction to DevOps, discussing how it bridges the gap between development and operations teams. The aim is to enhance collaboration, streamline workflows, and deliver software faster and more reliably.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **What is DevOps?**
   - **DevOps as a Culture and Practice**: DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle, increase deployment frequency, and improve the quality of software.
   - **DevOps vs Waterfall vs Agile**:
     - **Waterfall**: A traditional, linear, and sequential model.
     - **Agile**: Iterative, flexible, and more suitable for dynamic projects.
     - **DevOps**: Integrates development and operations to achieve Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).

### 2. **DevOps Lifecycle**
   The session covered the stages of the DevOps lifecycle:
   - **Plan**: Planning of new features or enhancements.
   - **Code**: Development of the actual software.
   - **Build**: Compilation and preparation of software for deployment.
   - **Test**: Automated testing for quality assurance.
   - **Release**: Packaging the software for release.
   - **Deploy**: Deploying the software to production or staging environments.
   - **Operate**: Managing the operation of the software in a live environment.
   - **Monitor**: Continuously monitoring the software for performance, bugs, and improvement opportunities.

### 3. **DevOps Practices**
   - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automating the integration of code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day.
   - **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**: Automatically pushing changes into production after passing testing phases.
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitoring the deployed applications and systems to ensure they are running smoothly and addressing any issues quickly.

### 4. **Tools in the DevOps Pipeline**
   Various tools that help automate the DevOps lifecycle were introduced:
   - **Planning**: Jira for project management.
   - **Source Control**: Git for version control.
   - **CI/CD**: Jenkins and GitHub Actions for automating builds, testing, and deployment.
   - **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and metrics.

### 5. **Collaboration Among Stakeholders**
   - **Stakeholders in DevOps**: Developers, clients, testers, operations, and business teams.
   - **Roles and Responsibilities**: Each stakeholder plays a key role in the successful delivery and continuous improvement of software products. Developers build, testers ensure quality, operations deploy, and business teams oversee product success.

## Hands-on Lab: AWS EC2 and IAM Setup

During the session, we also performed a hands-on lab where we:
1. Launched an **EC2 instance** in AWS using Amazon Linux 2.
2. Connected to the EC2 instance via SSH.
3. Created an **IAM user** with the necessary permissions.
4. Installed and configured the **AWS CLI** to interact with AWS services via the terminal.

This lab gave us practical exposure to using AWS, which is critical for implementing DevOps pipelines, hosting applications, and managing cloud resources.

## Key Takeaways
- DevOps is essential for enhancing collaboration between development and operations.
- The DevOps lifecycle helps streamline the entire software development process.
- Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Monitoring improve software efficiency and quality.
- Tools like Jenkins, Git, and Jira play an essential role in automating and optimizing DevOps processes.
  
## Conclusion
Day 1 of the DevOps training provided an insightful introduction to DevOps practices and principles. The hands-on experience with AWS and IAM setup was also valuable in understanding the real-world application of DevOps in cloud environments. We are now well-equipped with the fundamental knowledge to dive deeper into DevOps tools and practices in upcoming sessions.
